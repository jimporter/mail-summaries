# Mail Summaries

This is an experiment to reimplement the Mail Summaries add-on for Thunderbird
102+. It's very WIP, so you probably shouldn't use it unless you're extremely
brave!

## What Works

- Folder Summary

## What's Broken

- Account Summaries
- Context menus
- Platform-specific theming
- Non-English locales
- Prefs (including unsetting "remember selected message")
